## 🔧 **KEY TECHNICAL FIXES**

### **Fix 1: Payment Entry Linkage** ✅
```python
# BEFORE (not linked):
pe = frappe.get_doc({
    "custom_contract_reference": sales_order_name,
    # ❌ Missing references table!
})

# AFTER (properly linked):
pe.append("references", {
    "reference_doctype": "Sales Order",
    "reference_name": sales_order_name,
    "total_amount": grand_total,
    "allocated_amount": downpayment_amount
})
# ✅ Now linked properly!
```

### **Fix 2: Payment Schedule Update Hook** ✅
```python
# hooks.py
doc_events = {
    "Payment Entry": {
        "on_submit": "...payment_entry_linkage.on_submit_payment_entry"
    }
}

# This hook:
# 1. Updates advance_paid in Sales Order
# 2. Marks Payment Schedule rows as paid
# 3. Updates next_payment_date
# 4. Auto-updates Customer History data
```
